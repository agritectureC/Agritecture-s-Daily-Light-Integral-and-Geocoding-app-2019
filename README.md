# Daily Light Integral and Geocoding App

Daily light integral (DLI) describes the number of photosynthetically active photons that are delivered to a specific area over a 24-hour period. This variable is particularly useful to describe the light environment of plants.

In urban agriculture, DLI value is used for the selection of plants, projection of operating and capital costs. Based on user inputs such as location and cover transmittance value, latitude, longitude and daily light integral values are produced. 

The application uses Google Geocoding API to extract latitude value for the user's location and then calculates DLI value in 6 steps.
